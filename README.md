### Introduction
This workshop introduces participants to modern automation practices through two distinct hands-on sessions: **Event Automation** and **Data Integration with StreamSets**. Each session is designed to address different areas of enterprise automation and data flow orchestration.

### Digital Labour Workshop

This workshop is divided into two practical hands-on modules:

1. **Event Automation**  
   Explore how to build and manage event-driven workflows that respond to real-time business events. This session covers concepts like event producers/consumers, business rules, and automation triggers using enterprise-grade tools.

2. **Data Integration with StreamSets**  
   Learn how to create scalable, real-time data pipelines using IBM StreamSets. Youâ€™ll design and deploy pipelines that support data ingestion, transformation, and movement across cloud and on-premises environments.
