# Data Integration with StreamSets

This lab guides you through setting up a complete data integration flow using **StreamSets**, from environment setup to building a credit scoring machine learning pipeline.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A compatible operating system (Linux/macOS/Windows WSL)
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Access to [StreamSets](https://cloud.streamsets.com/)
- Git installed

---

### Step 1. Setup StreamSets Platform  
Begin by installing and configuring the StreamSets platform environment.

### Step 2. (Optional) Setup StreamSets Engine (Data Collector)  
If you're running a self-managed instance or want full control over your pipelines, set up your own StreamSets Data Collector engine.

### Step 3. Setup Pipeline: Data Generator  
This step walks you through creating a simulated data generator pipeline to feed downstream processing.

### Step 4. Setup Pipeline: Machine Learning (Credit Scoring)  
Finally, build and deploy a machine learning pipeline for credit scoring using the previously generated data.
